As researchers, we firmly believe in the concept of reproducible research.

Thus, we release the codes of simulation, algorithm development, and testing online on GitHub for the research paper "A rotation-invariant additive vector sequence based star pattern recognition" (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8430566/). This repository contains the codes for simulation and testing of the star identification algorithm based on a rotation-invariant additive vector sequence.

Please cite our paper (citation details below) properly, if you use the code for simulation, development or testing of a new star identification algorithm or comparison & benchmarking with the above-mentioned alogirhtm.

This code is only for academic and research purposes. Commerical use of this code is not permitted.
